# Status Page Overview

This status page provides a simple interface for checking the database connection status. It displays whether the application is able to connect to the database.

## Technical Details

### Data Fetching

The status page fetches the database connection status using the `checkDatabaseConnection` function, which is located in `src/features/dashboard/actions.ts`. This function attempts to connect to the database and returns a boolean indicating whether the connection was successful.

### Components

The status page is composed of the following main component:

-   `src/features/status/page.tsx`: This file displays the status page UI, including a loading spinner while checking the connection and the connection status.

### Styling

The status page uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Database

The status page checks the connection to a MySQL database. The database connection details are configured using environment variables.

## User-Friendly Explanation

The status page allows you to quickly check if the application is able to connect to the database. If the database is connected, the page will display "Database status: Connected" in green. If the database is disconnected, the page will display "Database status: Disconnected" in red. A loading spinner is displayed while the connection is being checked.
